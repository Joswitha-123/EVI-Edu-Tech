Embedded systems are specialized computing systems designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger system. Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are optimized for specific tasks and often have real-time performance requirements. They typically consist of a microcontroller or microprocessor, along with software and hardware tailored to the application they control. Embedded systems are found in a wide range of devices, from household appliances and medical equipment to automotive systems and industrial machines, providing efficient and reliable operation tailored to the needs of the application.

Very-Large-Scale Integration (VLSI) is the process of creating integrated circuits by combining thousands to millions of transistors onto a single chip. This technology enables the development of complex and high-performance semiconductor devices used in various applications, including microprocessors, memory chips, and digital signal processors. VLSI technology has been pivotal in advancing electronics, allowing for smaller, faster, and more power-efficient devices, and it is a fundamental aspect of modern digital and analog integrated circuits.

The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of interconnected devices that communicate and exchange data over the internet. These devices, which can range from household appliances and wearable technology to industrial machinery and smart city infrastructure, are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to collect and share data. IoT enables automation, improved efficiency, and enhanced decision-making by providing real-time insights and control over connected devices, making it a key driver in the evolution of smart technologies and digital transformation across various sectors.
